Drone Victory
=============
[Dronevictory.com](http://dronevictory.com) (still under development) is an application that informs users of the latest US military drone strikes around the world. Well, to be exact, it's an app that celebrates each drone strike as a VICTORY against terrorism, complete with garishly animated Americana, sounds of patriotic jubilation, and a look at the battlefield of planet Earth in the futuristic Globatron sports stadium. It's increasingly evident that ongoing drone assassinations perpetuate endless secret wars, seed new generations of terror attacks, and jeopardize national and international security. The celebration of drone attacks on [dronevictory.com](http://dronevictory.com) reflects the misguided, jingoistic and savage nature of these operations, while packaging the events in the form of entertainment that has the capacity to raise the public consciousness about drone warfare.
